# Mineral-Identification

This repo provides the dataset and code for reproducing the experiments in paper ---- Mineral Identification Based on Deep Learning That Combines Image and Mohs Hardness.

## Data

* We crawled 36 species of mineral images from the [mindat](https://www.mindat.org) website, a total of 183,688 images. 
* The specific species are as follows: Agate, Albite, Almandine, Anglesite, Azurite, Beryl, Cassiterite, Chalcopyrite, Cinnabar, Copper, Demantoid, Diopside, Elbaite, Epidote, Fluorite, Galena, Gold, Halite, Hematite, Magnetite, Malachite, Marcasite, Opal, Orpiment, Pyrite, Quartz, Rhodochrosite, Ruby, Sapphire, Schorl, Sphalerite, Stibnite, Sulphur, Topaz, Torbernite, Wulfenite.
* Also in order not to cause too much load burden on mindat, and to provide convenience to colleagues in the mineral identification field, we shared this dataset in this repo. [download link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uzhhvcQ8QKLE3O87udFYGc_ehqRwwppj/view).

## Application

* An app on smartphones using our trained model is implemented.
