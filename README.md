# Mineral-Identification

This repo provides the dataset for reproducing the experiments in paper ---- Mineral Identification Based on Deep Learning That Combines Image and Mohs Hardness.

We crawled 36 species of mineral images from the [mindat](https://www.mindat.org) website, a total of 183,688 images. Also in order not to cause too much load burden on mindat, and to provide convenience to colleagues in the mineral identification field, we shared this dataset in this repo.
