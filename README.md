# Mineral-Identification

This repo provides the dataset for reproducing the experiments in paper ---- Mineral Identification Based on Deep Learning That Combines Image and Mohs Hardness.

We crawled 34 species of mineral images from the [mindat](www.mindat.org) website, a total of 173,415 images. Also in order not to cause too much load burden on mindat, and to provide convenience to colleagues in the mineral identification field, we shared this dataset in this repo. For the download link of the dataset, see the release of this repo. [Direct link](https://github.com/treeAndRiver/Mineral-Identification/releases/tag/34minerals-dataset).
